          <p>Hi. My name is Max Levchin.
          <p>
          <p>I co-founded and am the CEO of <a href="http://affirm.com">Affirm</A>. We are going to remake consumer finance from the ground up.</p>
          </p>
          <p>My other main project is <A href="http://glowing.com">Glow</A>, where I am the Chairman. </p>
          <p>Both Affirm and Glow came out of my data-as-commodity project <a href="http://hvf.cc">HVF</a>, which is working on new products.</p>
          <p>I am also the Chairman of <a href="http://www.yelp.com/">Yelp</a>.</p>
          <p>I also founded and was CEO of Slide, which Google acquired, and subsequently shut down.</p>
          <p>I sit on the Board of Directors of <a href="http://yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a> </p>
          <p>Before all that, I co-founded and was CTO of <a href="http://www.paypal.com">PayPal</a>. You can take a look at some early <a href="/paypal-slideshow">PayPal photos</a> here.
          </p>
          <p>You are welcome to contact me via whatever channel you like, but please do not be offended if I never respond, as I tend to be very busy.</p>
          <p>I am on twitter as <a href="http://twitter.com/mlevchin">@mlevchin.</a></p>
          <p>Sometimes I invest in small companies. If you want to send me your "pitch", please consider recording a pitch video, posting it on YouTube, and sending me the link. I found this approach to be very time-efficient.</p>
